SUMMARY:Vetrnætr
DESCRIPTION:Vetrnætr\, or Winter Nights\, is one of the primary seasonal days found in the Norse branch of Heathenism\, and observes the end of the summer half of the year and the beginning of the winter half. This festival is mentioned in several of the Norse sagas\, and is one of the three seasonal festivals listed in Ynglingasaga\, along with a midwinter festival (likely Jólablót/Yule) and a victory sacrifice at the onset of summer (Sigrblót).

SUMMARY:Dísablót
DESCRIPTION:The Dísablót was the blót (sacrificial day) which was held in honour of the female spirits or deities called dísir (and the Valkyries)\, from pre-historic times until the Christianization of Scandinavia. Its purpose was to enhance the coming harvest. It is mentioned in Hervarar saga\, Víga-Glúms saga\, Egils saga and the Heimskringla. The celebration still lives on in the form of an annual fair called the Disting in Uppsala\, Sweden. The original day is unknown and speculated to be between mid-October and the beginning of March.

SUMMARY:Samhuinn
DESCRIPTION:A time that marked traditionally the ending and the beginning of the Celtic Year.\n\nSamhuinn\, from October 31st to November 2nd\, was a time of no time. Celtic society\, like all early societies\, was highly structured and organized – everyone knew their place. But to allow that order to be psychologically comfortable\, the Celts knew that there had to be a time when order and structure were abolished – when chaos could reign. And Samhuinn was such a time. Time was abolished for the three days of this festival\, and people did crazy things – men dressed as women and women as men. Farmers’ gates were unhinged and left in ditches\, peoples’ horses were moved to different fields\, and children would knock on neighbors’ doors for food and treats in a way that we still find today\, in a watered-down way\, in the custom of trick-or-treating on Hallowe’en.\n\nBut behind this apparent lunacy\, lay a deeper meaning. The Druids knew that these three days had a special quality about them. The veil between this world and the World of the Ancestors was drawn aside on these nights\, and for those who were prepared\, journeys could be made in safety to the ‘other side. The Druid rites\, therefore\, were concerned with making contact with the spirits of the departed\, who were seen as sources of guidance and inspiration rather than as sources of dread. The dark moon\, the time when no moon can be seen in the sky\, was the phase of the moon that ruled this time because it represents a time in which our mortal sight needs to be obscured in order for us to see into the other worlds.\n\nThe dead are honored and feasted\, not as the dead\, but as the living spirits of loved ones and of guardians who hold the root wisdom of the tribe. With the coming of Christianity\, this festival was turned into All Hallows [commonly referred to as Hallowe’en on October 31st]\, All Saints [November 1st] and All Souls [November 2nd]. Here we can see most clearly the way in which Christianity built on the pagan foundations it found rooted in these isles. Not only does the purpose of the festival match with the earlier one\, but even the unusual length of the festival is the same.

SUMMARY:Samhain
DESCRIPTION:Samhain (/ˈsɑːwɪn/) is one of the four Greater Sabbats among Wiccans. Samhain is typically considered a time to celebrate the lives of those who have passed on\, and it often involves paying respect to ancestors\, family members\, elders of the faith\, friends\, pets\, and other loved ones who have died.

SUMMARY:Álfablót
DESCRIPTION:The Álfablót or the Elven sacrifice is a pagan Scandinavian sacrifice to the elves towards the end of autumn when the crops had been harvested and the animals were mostly fat. Unlike the great blóts at Uppsala and Mære\, the álfablót was a local celebration at the homesteads that was mainly administered by the woman of the household. Nothing is known about the particular rites because they were surrounded by secrecy and strangers were not welcome to the homesteads during the celebrations. However\, since the elves were collective powers with a close connection to ancestors and fertility\, it is possible that the álfablót concerned ancestor worship and the life force of the family. It also appears that Odin was implied and that the master of the household was called Ölvir when administering the rites. The first element of Ölvir means "beer"\, which was an important element in Norse pagan sacrifices generally.

SUMMARY:Feast of the Einherjar
DESCRIPTION:Celebration to honor kin who died in battle.\n\nIn Norse mythology\, the einherjar (singular einheri) is literally "army of one"\, or "those who fight alone") are those who have died in battle and are brought to Valhalla by valkyries. In Valhalla\, the einherjar eat their fill of the nightly-resurrecting beast Sæhrímnir\, and valkyries bring them mead (which comes from the udder of the goat Heiðrún). The einherjar prepare daily for the events of Ragnarök when they will advance for an immense battle at the field of Vígríðr.\n

SUMMARY:Winter Solstice (Yule)
DESCRIPTION:Midwinter\, known commonly as Yule or within modern Druid traditions as Alban Arthan has been recognized as a significant turning point in the yearly cycle since the late Stone Age. The ancient megalithic sites of Newgrange and Stonehenge\, carefully aligned with the solstice sunrise and sunset\, exemplify this. The reversal of the Sun's ebbing presence in the sky symbolizes the rebirth of the solar god and presages the return of fertile seasons. From Germanic to Roman tradition\, this is the most important time of celebration.

SUMMARY:Alban Arthuan (The Light of Arthur)
DESCRIPTION:This is the time of death and rebirth. The sun appears to be abandoning us completely as the longest night comes to us. Linking our own inner journey to the yearly cycle\, the words of the Druid ceremony ask “Cast away\, O wo/man whatever impedes the appearance of light.” In the darkness\, we throw onto the ground the scraps of material we have been carrying that signify those things which have been holding us back\, and one lamp is lit from a flint and raised up on the Druid’s crook in the East. The year is reborn and a new cycle begins\, which will reach its peak at the time of the Midsummer Solstice\, before returning again to the place of death and birth.

SUMMARY:Birch Moon
DESCRIPTION:The Birch Moon is a time of rebirth and regeneration. As the Solstice passes\, it is time to look toward the light once more. When a forested area burns\, Birch is the first tree to grow back. The Celtic name for this month is Beth\, pronounced beh. Workings did this month add momentum and a bit of extra "oomph" to new endeavors. The Birch is also associated with magic done for creativity and fertility\, as well as healing and protection. Tie a red ribbon around the trunk of a Birch tree to ward off negative energy. Hang Birch twigs over a cradle to protect a newborn from psychic harm. Use Birch bark as magical parchment to keep writings safe.

SUMMARY:Rowan Moon
DESCRIPTION:The Rowan Moon is associated with Brighid\, the Celtic goddess of hearth and home. Honored on February 1\, at Imbolc\, Brighid is a fire goddess who offers protection to mothers and families\, as well as watching over the hearth fires. This is a good time of year to perform initiations (or\, if you're not part of a group\, do a self-dedication). Known by the Celts as Luis (pronounced loush)\, the Rowan is associated with astral travel\, personal power\, and success. A charm carved into a bit of a Rowan twig will protect the wearer from harm. The Norsemen were known to have used Rowan branches as rune staves of protection. In some countries\, Rowan is planted in graveyards to prevent the dead from lingering around too long.

SUMMARY:Imbolc
DESCRIPTION:Druidry has eight markers\, which means that every six weeks or so\, we have the opportunity to step out of the humdrum of daily life\, to honour the conjunction of Place and Time.\n\nThe next Festival occurs on February 2nd or the eve of February 1st. It is called Imbolc in the Druid tradition\, or sometimes Oimelc. Although we would think of Imbolc as being in the midst of Winter\, it represents in fact the first of a trio of Spring celebrations\, since it is the time of the first appearance of the snowdrop\, and of the melting of the snow and the clearing of the debris of Winter. It is a time when we sense the first glimmer of Spring\, and when the lambs are born. In the Druid tradition\, it is a gentle\, beautiful festival in which the Mother Goddess is honoured with eight candles rising out of the water at the centre of the ceremonial circle.\n\nThe Goddess that ruled Samhuinn was the Cailleach\, the Grey Hag\, the Mountain Mother\, and the Dark Woman of Knowledge. But by Imbolc\, the Goddess has become Brighid\, the Goddess of poets\, healers and midwives.

He was born for the sole purpose of avenging Baldr and does this by killing Höðr\, who was an unwitting participant and binding Loki with the entrails of his son Narfi. Váli grew to full adulthood within one day of his birth\, and slew Höðr before going on to Loki. He is prophesied to survive Ragnarök.

SUMMARY:Ash Moon
DESCRIPTION:In the Norse Eddas\, Yggdrasil\, the world tree\, was an Ash. The spear of Odin was made from the branch of this tree\, which is also known by the Celtic name Nion\, pronounced knee-un. This is one of three trees sacred to the Druids (Ash\, Oak\, and Thorn)\, and this is a good month to do magic that focuses on the inner self. Associated with ocean rituals\, magical potency\, prophetic dreams\, and spiritual journeys\, the Ash can be used for making magical (and mundane) tools -- these are said to be more productive than tools made from other wood. If you place Ash berries in a cradle\, it protects the child from being taken away as a changeling by mischievous Fae.

SUMMARY:Alder Moon
DESCRIPTION:At the time of the Spring Equinox\, or Ostara\, the Alder is flourishing on riverbanks\, roots in the water\, bridging that magical space between both heaven and earth. The Alder month\, called Fearn by the Celts and pronounced fairin\, is a time for making spiritual decisions\, magic relating to prophesy and divination\, and getting in touch with your own intuitive processes and abilities. Alder flowers and twigs are known as charms to be used in Faerie magic. Whistles were once made out of Alder shoots to call upon Air spirits\, so it's an ideal wood for making a pipe or flute if you're musically inclined.

SUMMARY:Spring Equinox (Ostara)
DESCRIPTION:Derived from a reconstruction produced by linguist Jacob Grimm of an Old High German form of the Old English goddess name Ēostre\, Ostara marks the vernal equinox in some modern Pagan traditions.\n\nKnown as Alban Eilir to modern Druid traditions\, this time period is the second of three spring celebrations (the midpoint between Imbolc and Beltane)\, during which light and darkness are again in balance\, with the light on the rise. It is a time of new beginnings and of life emerging further from the grips of winter.

SUMMARY:Alban Eilir (Light of the Earth)
DESCRIPTION:Time moves on\, and in a short while\, we come to the Spring Equinox – the time of equality of day and night when the forces of the light are on the increase. At the center of the trio of Spring Festas\, Alban Eilir [the Light of the Earth] marks the more recognizable beginnings of Spring\, when the flowers are beginning to appear and when the sowing begins in earnest.\n\nAs the point of psychological development in our lives\, it marks the time of late childhood to 14 years – Imbolc marking the time of early childhood [say to 7yrs].\n\nWe are in the Spring of our lives – the seeds that are planted in our childhood time of Imbolc and Alban Eilir will flower from the Beltane time of adolescence onwards as capacities and powers that will help us to negotiate our lives with skill and accomplishment.

SUMMARY:Vinya Loa
DESCRIPTION:March 28th: Vinya Loa (‘New Year’). Yestarë is the first day of the Elven Year (loa) and the eve of Spring (Tuilë). Though no specific festival is detailed\, this is probably something like Ostara. First Spring flowers (snowdrops and crocuses) are blooming\, snow is disappearing\, and the new life which appeared in ‘Stirring’ (Coirë) is beginning to burgeon. Also\, it is the New Year\, and so probably had a something of a New Year's feel to it\, but probably amplified because of the vernal energies. A possible alternative name for this time is Gwirith (‘Young\, youthful’–this word was certainly also applied to new leaves/plant life).

The Willow grows best when there's lots of rain\, and in northern Europe\, there's no shortage of that this time of year. This is a tree associated with healing and growth\, for obvious reasons. A Willow planted near your home will help ward away danger\, particularly the type that stems from natural disasters such as flooding or storms.

DESCRIPTION:Traditionally the first day of summer in Ireland\, in Rome the earliest celebrations appeared in pre-Christian times with the festival of Flora\, the Roman goddess of flowers\, and the Walpurgisnacht celebrations of the Germanic countries.\n\nBeltane\, on May 1st\, marks the time of our adolescence and early wo/manhood. Spring is in full bloom\, and twin fires would be lit at this time\, through which would be passed the cattle after their long winter confinement\, or over which those hoping for a child or good fortune would jump.\n\nWe see traces of the Beltane celebrations on May Day when dancing around the maypole celebrates the fertility of the land and creates an echo of the ritual circle dances that must have been enacted in stone circles throughout the country.

Coming right on the heels of Beltane\, this month is a time when male potency is high — if you're hoping to conceive a child\, get busy this month! The Hawthorn has a raw\, phallic sort of energy about it — use it for magic related to masculine power\, business decisions\, and making professional connections. The Hawthorn is also associated with the realm of Faerie\, and when the Hawthorn grows in tandem with an Ash and Oak\, it is said to attract the Fae.

The Oak King rules over the summer months\, and this tree was sacred to the Druids. The Celts called this month Duir\, which some scholars believe to mean "door"\, the root word of "Druid." The Oak is connected with spells for protection and strength\, fertility\, money and success\, and good fortune. Carry an acorn in your pocket when you go to an interview or business meeting\; it will bring you good luck. If you catch a falling Oak leaf before it hits the ground\, you'll stay healthy the following year.

SUMMARY:Summer Solstice (Litha)
DESCRIPTION:Midsummer is one of the four solar days and is considered the turning point at which summer reaches its height and the sun shines longest. Among the Wiccan sabbats\, Midsummer is preceded by Beltane\, and followed by Lammas or Lughnasadh.\n\nSome Wiccan traditions call the festival Litha\, a name occurring in Bede's The Reckoning of Time (De Temporum Ratione\, eighth century)\, which preserves a list of the (then-obsolete) Anglo-Saxon names for the twelve months. Ærra Liða (first or preceding Liða) roughly corresponds to June in the Gregorian calendar and Æfterra Liða (following Liða) to July. Bede writes that "Litha means gentle or navigable because in both these months the calm breezes are gentle and they were wont to sail upon the smooth sea".

Light is at its maximum\, and this is the time of the longest day. It is at this time that the Druids hold their most complex ceremony. Starting at midnight on the eve of the Solstice\, a vigil is held through the night – seated around the Solstice fire. The night is over in a matter of hours\, and as light breaks\, the Dawn Ceremony marks the time of the sun’s rising on this most powerful day. At noon a further ceremony is held.

The ancients used the wood of the Holly in the construction of weapons\, but also in protective magic. Hang a sprig of Holly in your house to ensure good luck and safety for your family. Wear as a charm\, or make Holly Water by soaking leaves overnight in spring water under a full moon — then use the water as a blessing to sprinkle on people or around the house for protection and cleansing.

SUMMARY:Lughnasadh
DESCRIPTION:Lammas or Lughnasadh (/ˈluːnæsə/) is the first of the three Wiccan harvest festivals\, the other two being the autumnal equinox (or Mabon) and Samhain. Wiccans mark the holiday by baking a figure of the god in bread and eating it\, to symbolize the sanctity and importance of the harvest. Celebrations vary\, as not all Pagans are Wiccans. The Irish name Lughnasadh is used in some traditions to designate this holiday. Wiccan celebrations of this holiday are neither generally based on Celtic culture nor centered on the Celtic deity Lugh. This name seems to have been a late adoption among Wiccans. In early versions of Wiccan literature\, the festival is referred to as August Eve.\n\nThe name Lammas (contraction of loaf mass) implies it is an agrarian-based festival and feast of thanksgiving for grain and bread\, which symbolises the first fruits of the harvest.\n\nSix weeks later we come to the time of Lughnasadh on August 1st\, which marks the beginning of harvest time. The hay would have been gathered in\, and the time for reaping the wheat and barley was due. It was a time of gathering together\, of contests and games and of marriages. The marriages contracted at this time could be annulled at the same time the following year – offering the couple a sensible ‘trial period’. In some areas a flaming wheel was sent rolling down the hillside at this time to symbolise the descent of the year towards Winter\, and in the Druid ceremony\, a wheel is passed around the circle in symbol of the turning year.

This is the time of year when Hazelnuts are appearing on the trees and are an early part of the harvest. Hazelnuts are also associated with wisdom and protection. Hazel is often associated in Celtic lore with sacred wells and magical springs containing the salmon of knowledge. This is a good month to do workings related to wisdom and knowledge\, dowsing and divination\, and dream journeys. If you're a creative type\, such as an artist\, writer\, or musician\, this is a good month to get your muse back and find inspiration for your talents.

DESCRIPTION:The day of the autumnal equinox\, Harvest Home\, Mabon\, the Feast of the\nIngathering\, Meán Fómhair\, An Clabhsúr\, or Alban Elfed (in Neo-Druid\ntraditions)\, is a modern Pagan ritual of thanksgiving for the fruits of the\nEarth and a recognition of the need to share them to secure the blessings of the\nGoddess and the Gods during the coming winter months. The name Mabon was coined by Aidan Kelly around 1970 as a reference to Mabon ap Modron\, a character from Welsh mythology. Among the sabbats\, it is the second of the three Pagan harvest festivals\, preceded by Lammas / Lughnasadh and followed by Samhain.

DESCRIPTION:The Autumnal Equinox\, on September 21st or thereabouts\, is called Alban Elfed or Light of the Water in the Druid tradition. It represents the second of the harvest festivals – this time marking the end of harvest time\, just as Lughnasadh marked its beginning. Again day and night are equally balanced as they were at the time of the Spring Equinox\, but soon the nights will grow longer than the days and Winter will be with us. In the ceremony\, we give thanks for the fruits of the earth and for the goodness of the Mother Goddess.\n\nAnd so the circle completes itself as we come again to the time of Samhuinn – the time of death and of rebirth.

Ivy can be used in magic performed for healing\, protection\, cooperation\, and to bind lovers together.

SUMMARY:Reed Moon
DESCRIPTION:Reed is typically used to make wind instruments\, and this time of year\, its haunting sounds are sometimes heard when the souls of the dead are being summoned to the Underworld. The Reed Moon was called Negetal\, pronounced nyettle by the Celts\, and is sometimes referred to as the Elm Moon by modern Pagans. This is a time for divination and scrying. If you're going to have a seance\, this is a good month to do it. This month\, do magical workings related to spirit guides\, energy work\, meditation\, the celebration of death\, and honoring the cycle of life and rebirth.

SUMMARY:Elder Moon
DESCRIPTION:The winter solstice has passed\, and the Elder moon is a time of endings. Although the Elder can be damaged easily\, it recovers quickly and springs back to life\, corresponding to the approaching New Year. Called Ruish by the Celts (pronounced roo-esh)\, the month of the Elder is a good time for workings related to creativity and renewal. It is a time of beginnings and endings\, births and deaths\, and rejuvenation. Elder is also said to protect against demons and other negative entities. Use magic connected to Faeries and other nature spirits.
